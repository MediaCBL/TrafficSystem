# Traffic System Plugin

## Overview

The **Traffic System Plugin** provides a modular and extensible framework for managing AI-driven traffic in Unreal Engine.  
It is designed to simulate vehicle movement along splines, handle intersections, basic collision awareness, and traffic flow logic in a clean and reusable way.

The system focuses on:
- Clear separation between traffic logic and game-specific rules
- Plugin-level reusability across projects
- Blueprint-friendly workflows for designers
- Performance-aware runtime behavior

The plugin is intended for arcade, simulation, and cinematic use cases where predictable and controllable traffic behavior is required.
